# Loki: Your Stateful Prototyping/Dev/Research/Ops Agent in your AWS account

> **TL;DR — one command to deploy:**
> ```
> bash <(curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inceptionstack/loki-agent/main/install.sh)
> ```
> Requires: AWS CLI configured, admin access on a dedicated AWS account. The script walks you through everything.
>
> ⚠️ **We highly recommend deploying Loki in a brand-new, dedicated AWS account.** Loki has admin-level access and LLMs can make mistakes — a clean account limits the blast radius. Start with prototyping work as you learn and get acquainted with its capabilities. Like any powerful tool, it carries risks; isolating it in its own account is the simplest way to manage them.
>
> ⚠️ **This is an experiment, not a security product.** Loki can enable AWS security services and flag findings, but it does not replace professional security review, compliance auditing, or threat modeling. An LLM with admin access can cause damage — treat it accordingly.
>
> **To remove a Loki deployment:**
> ```
> bash <(curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inceptionstack/loki-agent/main/uninstall.sh)
> ```
>
> After your first chat, run the [Bootstrap Scripts](https://github.com/inceptionstack/loki-agent/wiki/Bootstrap-Scripts-Guide) to set up security, skills, memory search, and more.

## What's This Experiment About?
What if you gave OpenClaw its own AWS account to manage and control, and ask it to build stuff for you?

## The Problem: Infrastructure Eats Your Time

Building a prototype has never been faster. Tools like Lovable, Base44, and Bolt let any developer go from idea to working demo in minutes. For simple frontend apps with basic CRUD, these platforms deliver genuine speed. The prototype side of the equation is largely solved.

The problem begins the moment a team decides to build something real on AWS. Even experienced engineers who know exactly what they want to build spend days on infrastructure before writing a single line of business logic: provisioning compute, designing IAM policies, configuring networking, setting up CI/CD pipelines, instrumenting monitoring, and establishing security baselines. For a solo founder or a small team without dedicated DevOps resources, this can create huge delays or might mean never get to a shipping product fast enough (or at all).

The alternative is (and what most solo founders and scrappy teams might do) building quickly on a rapid-development platform and migrating to AWS later. That creates a different set of problems. These platforms are "black box", can't access real AWS services except what is prescribed (if at all), and require complete rewrites when teams outgrow them. The technical debt accumulates silently until someone needs a (different, or more complicated) payment integration, a compliance requirement, or a workload the platform simply can't support (special backend APIs or even an API only product, specialized data schemas or graphs, special scale provisions, specialized security options and more). At that point, the team faces a choice between a costly rewrite and staying on a platform that limits what they can build.

**It would be great if developers didn't have to choose between speed and control.**


---

## Why This Is Solvable Now

Three capabilities have converged to make this problem solvable for the first time.

**1. AI agents that actually work.** OpenClaw (and other claw-like tools), the open-source AI agent framework, proved at scale that users (some are developers) will trust an AI agent to execute shell commands, manage files, and interact with APIs — when the agent is capable and the human retains control. It reached 317k GitHub stars in 6 weeks, one of the fastest adoption curves in open-source history.

**2. Infrastructure-as-code is mature.** aws-cli, Terraform, AWS CDK, CloudFormation,  SAM and other tooling make resource provisioning fully programmable. An AI agent can generate, modify, and deploy infrastructure using the same tools a human engineer would use — producing output that is auditable, version-controlled, and reversible.

**3. Foundation models can reason about architecture.** Models like Anthropic Claude support the context windows and tool-use reliability required for multi-step infrastructure provisioning. They can reason about full-stack application architecture, generate correct configurations, and maintain context across multi-hour build sessions.

These three capabilities are the building blocks. **Loki is what you get when you combine them into a single, deployable package, and then give it its own AWS account to administer 24/7.**

## What Loki Does

Loki is an open-source, deploy-it-yourself AI agent that lives in your AWS account (usually one per account so the agents don't step on each other's toes) and builds real code, infrastructure, deployments and configurations. 

Clone the repo, deploy via CloudFormation, SAM, or Terraform, and within minutes you have a 24/7 agent running in your account , connected to Amazon Bedrock (by default, you can change that), loaded with AWS infrastructure skills, and ready to build. The agent is accessible via Telegram, Discord, Slack, or a terminal UI, and maintains full memory across sessions so it always knows what it built, what's deployed, and what state everything is in.

Loki handles the complete build lifecycle inside your AWS account:

* **Designs and deploys** serverless APIs, container workloads, and data pipelines
* **Writes application code**, pushes to repositories, and triggers CI/CD pipelines
* **Configures IAM policies**, security groups, and logging
* **Sets up CloudWatch monitoring** and can enable AWS security services (GuardDuty, Security Hub, etc.) on request
* **Debugs production issues** — reads CloudTrail logs, identifies root causes, and applies fixes

Everything Loki builds can use (but is not limited to) standard AWS services: CloudFormation or CDK or Terraform for infrastructure, CodeCommit or GitHub for code, Lambda or ECS for compute, DynamoDB or RDS for data. There's no proprietary runtime, no abstraction layer, and no migration required when your application grows beyond the prototype stage.

**You own everything.** Disable Loki tomorrow and your applications keep running. Every resource is visible in the AWS console, portable to any toolchain, and yours to modify.

### Difference from Cursor, Claude Code, Kiro and others

Unlike **AI coding tools** (Cursor, Kiro, Claude Code) that run on your laptop and stop when the laptop closes, Loki is a persistent agent that lives in your AWS account around the clock. Start a build on Tuesday, come back Thursday, and it knows exactly where things stand.

### Difference from Lovable, Bolt, Base44 etc

Unlike **rapid-dev platforms** (Replit, Lovable, Bolt) that abstract away infrastructure and trap your code in proprietary runtimes, Loki works *within* AWS. Your infrastructure is real AWS, managed by standard IaC tools, with no outside vendor lock-in (except AWS of course, but you could choose to build fully containerized apps with it so you can easily port them in the future).

### Difference from Standard OpenClaw Assistants

Unlike a **general-purpose AI assistant**, Loki ships with AWS infrastructure skills and the IAM permissions to actually provision resources. It's purpose-built for building and operating on AWS. **Instead of being fully locked down into a VM sandbox or docker sandbox, its sandbox is defined by the boundaries of the AWS account it lives in.**

It does not bundle any clawhub skills (huge security risk there), but comes with mostly AWS skills and playwright MCP using mcporter.

## Loki in Action

Real screenshots from actual usage — building apps, debugging infrastructure, and monitoring AWS resources.

### From prompt to deployed app

Describe what you want in plain English. Loki plans the architecture, writes the code, sets up CI/CD, and deploys — all while you watch or go do something else.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/loki-telegram-build.jpg" alt="Loki building a full-stack app from a conversational prompt" width="700" />
</p>

### Architecture planning before writing code

Before touching any code, Loki lays out a full architecture plan — data model, traffic flow, infrastructure components, and deployment strategy. You review and adjust before it starts building.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/loki-architecture-plan.jpg" alt="Loki planning full architecture with data model, traffic flow, and infrastructure" width="700" />
</p>

### Work from anywhere — it remembers everything

Pick up where you left off from any device. Loki has full memory of every project, every decision, every resource it deployed. No context-switching tax.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/loki-train-continue.jpg" alt="Continuing a conversation from a phone — Loki remembers the full project context" width="500" />
</p>

### Proactive morning briefing

Loki doesn't wait for you to ask. It sends daily reports covering AWS costs, security findings, critical CVEs, and pipeline status — before you open your laptop.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/loki-morning-briefing.jpg" alt="Loki morning briefing — AWS costs, security findings, CVEs, pipeline status" width="500" />
</p>

### CVE detection and patching

Loki can read from Security Hub, GuardDuty, and Inspector. When it finds CVE reports, it can propose fixes, rebuild container images, and verify the result. **This is a convenience feature, not a security guarantee — always review what it does.**

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/loki-security-fix.jpg" alt="Loki detecting 1 CRITICAL + 19 HIGH security findings and proposing fixes" width="400" />

</p>
<p align="center"><em>Left: Agent detects CVEs overnight. Right: All CVEs eliminated, app verified working.</em></p>

### Autonomous debugging

When something breaks, Loki traces the issue across VPCs, load balancers, route tables, and DNS — then fixes it and tells you what happened.

## A Day with Loki

Loki isn't a one-shot tool you open when you need something. It's an always-on partner that lives in your AWS account 24/7 — coding, deploying, monitoring, and improving while you focus on what matters.

| | Time | What Happens |
|---|---|---|
| 🌅 | **8:00 AM** | **Morning briefing lands.** Before you open your laptop, Loki sends a daily report: security findings summary, overnight spend ($3.20), CVEs flagged in your container images, all pipelines green. |
| ☕ | **9:30 AM** | **You have an idea.** Via SSM terminal: *"Build me a serverless REST API with DynamoDB, Cognito auth, and a React frontend."* By the time you finish your coffee — it's live, with tests, a CI/CD pipeline, and CloudWatch alarms. All IaC. |
| 🛡️ | **11:00 AM** | **Loki flags something.** A routine heartbeat check catches an overly permissive security group. Loki proposes tightening it, updates the CloudFormation template, and sends you a summary to review. |
| 📱 | **2:15 PM** | **Iterate from anywhere.** Message from your phone: *"Add a WebSocket endpoint to the API I built this morning."* Loki remembers the full architecture — no context needed. |
| 📋 | **5:30 PM** | **Wrap-up summary.** *"Summarize everything we built today."* Loki recaps: 2 new services deployed, 14 CloudFormation resources created, 3 pipelines configured, all tests passing. Copy-paste to your team. |
| 🌙 | **3:00 AM** | **While you sleep.** Scheduled jobs can audit your infrastructure against AWS best practices. Loki finds cost optimizations and flags improvements, logging everything for your morning review. |

## How It Works

Loki is built on [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw), the open-source AI agent framework. The [loki-agent](https://github.com/inceptionstack/loki-agent) repository packages everything needed to deploy a production-ready Loki instance:

**1. One-click deployment.** Choose your IaC tool  (CloudFormation, SAM, or Terraform) and deploy. The template creates an isolated VPC, a T4g.xlarge EC2 instance by default (recommended so it can really do things like build run tests, build code, dockerize things and more, as a real dev machine), IAM roles, security services, and installs Loki with a pre-configured workspace. Total deploy time: \~4-10 minutes.

**2. Configurable monitoring.** The deployment includes five individually toggleable AWS security services — Security Hub, GuardDuty, Inspector, Access Analyzer, and AWS Config — all enabled by default. For test/dev environments, disable what you don't need. The EC2 instance uses SSM Session Manager instead of SSH (no open ports), and the Loki gateway only listens on localhost (not exposed to the network). **Note:** Enabling these services doesn't make the agent itself secure — it means the agent can surface findings from these tools. You are still responsible for reviewing and acting on them.

**3. Observe → Plan → Act.** Loki reads the current state of your AWS account, plans the next actions, and executes them with full admin power. **(remember - with power comes resposibility. this is risky, so use it on a clean AWS account to minize blast radius of agent making mistakes)**

**4. Persistent memory.** Conversation history and agent memory are stored locally on the instance. Loki maintains workspace files (SOUL.md, TOOLS.md, MEMORY.md) that give it continuity across sessions and restarts. It knows what it built yesterday. 

**5. Your data stays yours.** The only external calls are to Amazon Bedrock for AI inference (processed under the Bedrock data privacy policy — your data is not used to train models). Alternatively, use your own Anthropic API key or a LiteLLM proxy. No code, infrastructure configurations, or application data leaves your account.


---

## Who It's For

**Solo founders and pre-seed teams (1–3 people)** frustrated by rapid-dev platform limitations such as no custom backend, no real AWS services, no path to production, who need to iterate quickly without accumulating technical debt.

**Small startup teams (2–10 people)** racing toward product-market fit with limited runway. They need sophisticated backend capabilities like payments, integrations, compliance and can't afford dedicated DevOps resources or have too much work on their hands already.

**Corporate innovation teams** building proofs of concept. They must comply with corporate security standards, can't use external platforms that require data to leave their AWS account, and are measured by speed of validation.

**Any developer** who knows what they want to build on AWS but doesn't want to spend a week on infrastructure before writing business logic to build a POC.


---

## Getting Started

### Option 1: One-command install (recommended)

```bash
bash <(curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inceptionstack/loki-agent/main/install.sh)
```

The installer verifies your AWS credentials, checks permissions, lets you pick an instance size and deployment method (CloudFormation/SAM/Terraform), deploys everything, and monitors progress until Loki is ready.

### Option 2: Manual deploy

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/inceptionstack/loki-agent.git
cd loki-agent/deploy/cloudformation

# Deploy
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name my-loki \
  --template-body file://template.yaml \
  --parameters ParameterKey=EnvironmentName,ParameterValue=my-loki \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
  --region us-east-1

# Wait ~10 min, then connect
aws ssm start-session --target <instance-id>

# Talk to your Loki
openclaw tui
```

### Uninstall

Remove one or all Loki deployments from your account:

```bash
bash <(curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inceptionstack/loki-agent/main/uninstall.sh)
```

Finds deployments by tag, lets you pick which to remove, deletes CloudFormation stacks or cleans up resources manually (Terraform deploys), and optionally removes state buckets/lock tables.

## Principles


1. **Production-shaped from the start.** Every application Loki builds (assuming given the right instructions and system prompt) includes infrastructure as code, CI/CD, monitoring, and scoped IAM . A prototype that can't be promoted to production is a demo, not a prototype.
2. **You own everything.** Loki operates inside your AWS account. Every resource it creates is visible in the console, portable to any toolchain, and fully functional if the agent is removed. No abstraction layer, no vendor lock-in, no proprietary runtime.
3. **Speed without shortcuts.** Loki collapses code + deploy + infrastructure setup from days to minutes. This can include security configuration, monitoring, and CI/CD.
4. **Transparency over autonomy.** Every action is logged to CloudTrail. You can see exactly what Loki built, modified, or deleted at any time.  This also allows powerful debugging of failing apps while it happens, with fast corrections. 
5. **Meet developers where they are.** Accessible from Telegram, Discord, Slack, or a terminal.

## Cost Estimates

| Component | Estimated Monthly Cost |
|-----------|------------------------|
| EC2 t4g.medium (24/7) | \~$25                  |
| EC2 t4g.xlarge (24/7) (recommended for complex dev work) | \~$100                 |
| EBS volumes (40GB + 80GB) | \~$10                  |
| Bedrock (moderate use, sonnet 4.6) (recommended: opus 4.6 for main tasks, sonnet 4.6 for subagents) assuming you're building every day. | $300–$2000 (or much more if you're very active on opus 4.6)             |
| Security services | \~$5 (individually toggleable) |
|           |                        |
|           |                        |

Loki can estimate costs before provisioning resources and summarize your actual AWS spend at any time. Set [AWS Budgets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/budgets-managing-costs.html) alerts during setup.

## ⚠️ Risks — Read This

Loki has **administrator access** to your AWS account. This is what makes it useful — and what makes it dangerous. Be honest with yourself about the tradeoffs:

* **LLMs make mistakes.** They can misconfigure IAM policies, delete resources they shouldn't, create overly permissive security groups, or run up costs with unintended resource creation. This is not hypothetical — it will happen.
* **Admin access means admin-level damage.** If the model hallucinates a destructive command, it has the permissions to execute it. There is no approval gate by default (though you can configure one).
* **This is not a security product.** Loki can enable GuardDuty and read Security Hub findings, but an LLM summarizing security alerts is not the same as a security operations team. Don't use it as your security posture — use it as a convenience layer that surfaces information.
* **Non-deterministic behavior.** The same prompt can produce different results on different days. Infrastructure changes are not always reversible.

**Mitigations we recommend:**

1. **Dedicated sandbox account.** This is the single most important thing you can do. If Loki breaks something, the blast radius is one account.
2. **AWS Budgets with alerts.** Set a spending cap from day one.
3. **CloudTrail is always on.** Every API call Loki makes is logged. Review the trail periodically.
4. **Start small.** Build a todo app before you ask it to architect a multi-service platform.
5. **Review what it builds.** Loki shows you what it's doing. Read it. Question it.


---

## Limitations

Loki is:

* **Non-deterministic.** Given the same request, it may produce different results. For complex architecture, a developer/architect with AWS experience gets significantly better results — the agent amplifies expertise, it doesn't substitute for it.
* **Single-account scope.** Loki operates within one AWS account. It's not designed for multi-account orchestration (yet).
* **Not a security tool.** Loki can enable and read from AWS security services, but it is not a substitute for security engineering, compliance auditing, or threat modeling. An LLM with admin access can introduce security issues just as easily as it finds them.
* **Prototyping-to-production, not at-scale operations.** Loki can monitor and debug what it builds, but it's not a replacement for dedicated operations tooling for high-scale production workloads.
